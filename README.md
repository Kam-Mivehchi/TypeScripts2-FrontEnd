# TYPESCRIPTS 2.0

## Objective

Our goal was to refactor our previous [TypeScripts](https://github.com/Kam-Mivehchi/TypeScripts) application from a handlebarsjs build into a more modern react framework. TypeScripts is an application where the user is able to practice their typing speed and accuracy while learning/practicing coding languages at the same time. In the current build, the user is able to practice, Typescripts, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and plain english.

## Description

TypeScripts is a typing game for all developers, new and experienced alike; where users are able to see their typing skills when typing code. We noticed that a lot of the typing quizes or games didn't offer developer modes where you can type code instead of random words and sentences and sought to provide a solution in the form of TypeSCripts. This being our very first full stack development project, we learned a lot about technical skills and social skills when working in a team.

## Note

This TypeScripts build is a decoupled set up, with the server repository location [here](https://github.com/OmarAce/TypeScripts2-Backend). There is also a development build that utilized concurrently for client/server testing with a large majority of the commit history [here](https://github.com/Kam-Mivehchi/TypeScripts-2).
